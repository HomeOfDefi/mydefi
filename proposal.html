                I asked Clouton a few questions, here are the answers: <br>
                <br>
                
                What blockchain are we launching on? - Polygon (could move to Avax) <br>
                <br>
                
                What is the max supply for the token? - I think a max supply of 10,000,000 is fine. 1,000,000 released on launch. <br>
                 <br>
                Starting price of the token? - $8 <br>
                <br>
                How much is the course going to cost? - 31 $WAND (~$250). We could also think about raising the price every X amount sold. <br>
                <br>
                Are we doing a whitelist for the token? - Yes <br>
                <br>
                How much of the token is kept for team? - Discuss closer to the time <br>
                <br>
                How are the funds distributed from the Witches mint? - Already decided <br>
                <br>
                Are we going to recruit writers to release articles on the gated website? If so, incentive? - Yes, paid in $WAND <br>
                <br>
                What is the mint price for the witches? I think we need to work out how much capital we're going to need to fund our other ventures, what we value the witches at. In other words, get the finances straight for ALL out other ventures. Should not be arbitary number imo <br>
                <br>
                Are we going to launch the mint, token, staking and course all on the same day? No. Staking and $WAND will be released a few days later. Courses released later <br>
                <br>
                How will the courses be formatted? I think you (Clouton) should work on this and I can copy <br>
                <br>
                Do we need a website for the Wizards and Witches or are we going to just use the minting dapps and have 1 WizardFinance website? Already made websites for all <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                The second point of our discussion was in regards to how things are going to be ran internally in the company, once everything is launched. Here is the answer to one of the structure points: <br>
                <br>
                (Message written from DeFi POV) <br>
                <br>
                Job descriptions - I believe your personality and strengths are more suited for the "CEO" type. It's good to have someone who can attend meeting, interviews, AMAs, spaces and talk confidently, as well as someone who is intellectually smart and can provide good ideas to complicated tasks. I don't think I am suited for these types of jobs and would prefer (for me and the project) to just work on all the technical aspects, researching for the treasury and managing the treasury, finding partners, collecting data etc and then just report everything back to you. In business terms I guess I could refer to myself as the CIO/CTO/COO. Obviously we are a small team, so there isn't just 1 job title we can delegate to eachother, but I think this is the basis off what we should work from. <br>
                <br>
                If we are to go with these "titles". What would it entail for both of us? <br>
                <br>
                For me (DeFi), you could expect to see me doing weekly cash-flow analysis, strengths and weakness within the project, researching for the treasury, websites/contracts (even though they are done for now), managing the treasury, finding partnerships, managing day to day activities etc. <br>
                <br>
                For you (Clouton), I think you could act as the public face of the company. For example, I can set up spaces, interviews, AMAs, I can create PowerPoints and reports monthly that you can go over on a live chat, you can make the final decision on recruitments, I can provide you with the weekly analysis. You could also create a business plan and strategy and It is my job to make sure it is executed properly. <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                Esentially, the reason for the discussion was that we think the project is a bit all over the place internally, which is no fault of the mods. At the moment there is not much structure, people are not sure of the role they play or what is expected of them so I am working on changing that. Over the next week I want us to have a full discussion about how interested you all are in staying and working on the project. Moving forward, there is going to be a LOT of work needed to be done. Ranging from the courses, building a community, the Wizards and Witches, the websites, marketing etc. To achieve this we are going to need everyone fully committed. I know you all have other priorites so it's a little tough to be committed all the time, so I do understand that. <br>
                <br>
                Moving forward, everyone will be on a salary and assigned "titles" and "expectations" with the chance to move up the ladder if you so wish. Paid fully in $WAND for the first few months (USD thereafter), aswell as receive their portion of the minted funds. Although, like I said, we need everyone fully committed. We can not build a fully functional digital company if there are "employees" who are only showing up for 10 minutes of the day. Also, it is not fair on the rest of the team. It's important to remember that we are moving away from being an NFT project and rebranding to a company that offers services in return for payment. Out of respect to the consumers we have to put everything into fulfilling the services promised, which is going to be a lot of work. <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                After we've had a team discussion, I will create a full report with roles, expectations, rules, policies etc. If we want this to be a successful company, we need to start acting as though it already is.
