                <br>
                In recent weeks, the market has been in a constant downtrend. As a team we were building during the bear market with confidence that we could succeed no matter what the market conditions, which we still believe. Those of you who have been here from the start will know we were preparing for these market conditions, and we were ready to be prepared for when the time comes. Unfortunately, due to a slow start to the project we were very limited on what we could invest in. We felt like we had to take on a lot of risk. One to attract new investors, two to please the already existing holders with a promised giveaway, which depsite the market conditions we were able to achieve. <br />
                <br />
                We feel like we shot ourselves in the foot by revealing our investment strategy so early on into the project. We knew for weeks prior to investing in $STRNGR that it was most likely going to be a in a constant decline, as it was from $1000. We feel like we had an obligation to invest in it since that is what we were saying from the very start. We have a very skilled team, with experienced trading/investing knowledge, but with a small treasury, we're very limited and unable to take any type of risk at all.<br />
                <br />
                The team has been doing a lot of thinking, talking and ultimately beating ourselves up over the last few weeks. Thinking of ways to move forward, alternative ways to provide utility and bring value to the NFTs despite slow minting. We were in contact with multiple influencers and advisors advising us on ways to pick up mints. We were working really hard and doing everything we could for the community. At first we weren't too worried since we had 13 nodes which was providing us with relatively steady income, at least enough so that we could host giveaways. Having a giveaway while we worked away in the background was fine, it's the bear market and everything is moving slower. It's just part of the game. <br />
                <br />
                With $STRNGR now below $5 we aren't actually bringing in any revenue. By the time we pay node fees and gas fees, it is actually costing more to maintain the nodes than the nodes are accruing. This is when we started to get really worried. We had $400, 13 nodes that were costing more to maintain than were generating returns, $ETH fell to $1200 making it $25 to mint and on top of that we still weren't getting any mints. <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                Our proposal is for the team to start working on the design of the 3D stakeable NFTs, the token and the tokenomics. In the meantime we will cut the supply of OG Wizards to 1000 and make them a free mint. Our hopes for this would be that people would have more interest in our community if they were actually holding one, it'd also give us a chance to potentially get some OpenSea volume and give us more of a chance of selling out 3D stakeable NFTs, which will be 100x better art and way more utility. A snapshot was taken prior to the release of this announcement and if the proposal passes OG Wizards will receive a stakeable NFT for free at a 1:2 ratio. For example, if you hold 1 OG Wizard you will receive 2 3D stakeable Wizards. The supply and mint price is TBA. <br />
                <br />
                We will still hold giveaways from royalty fees, they will not be as big of course but it is a way for us to continue with the utility until we've fully released the 3D NFTs. <br />
                <br />
                OG Wizards will work in unison with the 3D NFTs and the OG Wizards will still be used as a lottery ticket AFTER the release of the 3Ds. OG holders will not be diluted. This is a way to bring more value back to OG holders, who are ultimately the reason this project even made it in the first place.<br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                We feel as though a decision has to be made if we want this project to succeed. Surviving the bear market with such little capital is almost impossible. As you know we are not a team that quits, but we are a team that will do what we must to keep the project striving. We hope the community can give us their full support on this.<br />
                <br />
                We are aware that people are more likely to have a vested interest in the project if they are more emotionally attached to it, which we believe is only achieved through holding the token. Ie owning a Wizard. During bear markets people are often scared to invest, it makes sense given the current economic state of the world. We've seen a huge influx in free mint projects. If you've been in crypto for a while you'll know that the narratives are constantly changing and it's better to be on the right side of the trend that the wrong one. As they say, the trend is your friend. People don't seem to want to get involved with anything that isn't free. We're not the only project that has seen a slow start, there is a lot of really interesting projects with dedicated teams that haven't done well simply because their mint wasn't free. Our goal has always been to provide an NFT with intrinsic value, whether it be through staking or giveaways. This has always remained top priority and always will. However, like we've reitirated from the start, for us to maintain giveaways we need mints. While it's our job to incentive people to mint, ultimately it comes down to the buyer. We hope that by making OG Wizards free to mint, we can gather that vested interest, build a strong community, increase engagements, increase members and followers while having a proper marketing strategy for the 3D NFTs. In doing so there would be demand for the stakeable NFTs and $WAND, meaning while you're staking to earn $WAND the price is increasing. All OG Wizards who got in early will be benefit massively from this.<br />
                <br />
                The team will have a full transparent plan regarding how we plan to increase secondary market volume for OG Wizards. We'd still like to hold weekly giveaways, so secondary market volume is very important. It might also provide you with a way to release some of your NFTs, especially those of you who hold multiple. Secondary market volume will be critical in securing a complete sell out of the stakeable NFTs, so while we think the art will speak for itself, we'll also continue striving to push for OpenSea volume. Once we have hit our targeted amount of volume on OpenSea, we see a significant increase in members, followers, activity and engagement, we will release the 3D NFTs.<br />
                <br /> 
                We will have multiple ways to achieve a whitelist. Giveaways, purchasing an OG Wizard on OpenSea, activity etc. Once all the criteria has been hit, the whitelist spots filled and the contract is tried and tested, we'll begin distributing the 3D NFTs to OG holders. Pre-sale will begin 24 hours later and public sale 24 hours after that. Once we've had a complete sell out we'll announce the date of the reveal.<br />
                <br /> 
                The 3D NFTs will be a much more unique collection with less supply yet more traits. OG 1 of 1 Wizards will be airdropped a 1 of 1 3D NFT with the same special ability as the OG Wizard. We'll create more 1 of 1 3D NFTs, some for giveaways and some will be randomly minted. <br /> 
                <br /> 
                The tokenomics of the token will be absolutely critical to the success of the stakeable NFTs, so while we can't give any updates on that, rest assured that we'll go through everything carefully to give holders the best annual return but also at a sustainable level. In the future we'll provide more utilites for the token, meaning there will be demand to meet the sell side pressure.<br /> 
                <br /> 
                A proposal will go live in our discord 1 hour after the announcement. Please vote, the future of WonderlandWizards depends on it!   <br />
