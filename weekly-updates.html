                You'll be happy to hear that we've brought in someone who has experience in marketing, and he is currently drafting up a marketing strategy along with advising us on how we can create growth. He's already given us advice on some really useful tools that will help with creating tweets, threads and articles. We've also decided to cancel the weekly AMAs and instead do them once a month. We will still be providing weekly updates but in written form, through the WonderlandWizards substack. Most people miss the AMAs for various different reasons and miss out on some quality discussions. We hope the transition to an article format will reach a wider audience. Another reason for doing this is so we have more topic for discussions during Twitter spaces which we want to be pushing out a lot more over the next few weeks. Due to the Twitter algorithm we're seeing more people in the spaces, especially new people. It also give us another way to push out to serious investors who most likely aren't going to be in our discords.<br />
              <br />
              Currently, we are messaging a lot of projects who we think will bring value, as well as trying to schedule some spaces for the Wizards. We will have further updates on this as the conversations progress. We're also going to host a mega space, so if you're bullish or involved in any projects that might want to get involved and come and pitch their projects, let them know.<br />
              <br />
              We also added mint incentives yesterday which are above this announcement. If you missed it be sure to give it a check and let your Wizard friends know. The incentives don't stop there though, we'll be adding more periodically. Stay tuned!<br />
              <br />
              Although the gas fees are frustrating it seems as though NFTs that
              hold their value, live on the Ethereum blockchain.

                Our initial plan was to invest in HORDE and Grape finance. Due to the fact that we're whitelisted for SolarProtocol and able to buy at a discount, we've decided that it would be better to sit on our hands until pre-sale launch, allowing us to make as many nodes as possible. For those that asked, we'll still be diversifying into grape and horde once we start accruing rewards from Solar "nodes".
              <br />
              <br />
              $STRNGR is still in a downtrend and we won't be investing anymore into Stronger nodes until we receive confirmation or further updates regarding StrongChain. We're still bullish long term and looking forward to Dapps being built on top of StrongChain, driving demand for Stronger. Until then we'll act accordingly so we can continue with giveaways, if holders choose it.

                I will begin working on the custom Wizards and contract over the next week or two. To those who won the giveaways, thank you for being patient.<br />
              <br />
              I will also give current holders the chance to win a custom Wizard, so expect that over the next few days.<br />

              Many people wonder what is the point in buying a Wizard apart from the giveaway? Let me tell you. During phase 2, we'll begin the design of the 3D W***s, I'll let you guess the nameðŸ˜‰ <br>
              <br>
              We'll then create a WonderlandWizards token, ticker symbol $WAND. <br>
              <br>
              You'll be able to stake your 3D NFT and earn $WAND. <br>
              <br>
              We have a team with a wide range of knowledge that will go through all the tokenomics to make sure they're sustainable but also provide holders with a nice APY. Clouton will be managing the Whitelist for the tokens so reach out to him if you have any questions. <br>
              <br>
              Phase 1 holders will receive the stakeable NFT for free, at a 1:1 ratio. For example, if you hold 10 Wizards you'll receive 10 3D stakeable NFTs. <br>
              <br>
              A snapshot will be taken as soon as we sell the first 500. All of this will be made available a few weeks after the sell out of phase 4. <br>
              <br>
              Although this all seems so far away right now, I hope it serves to shows you that we're not just your average cash grab NFT, we're here for the long term, with real goals and plans that we WILL achieve, no matter how long it takes. <br>
