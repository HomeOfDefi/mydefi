                You'll be happy to hear that we've brought in someone who has experience in marketing, and he is currently drafting up a marketing strategy along with advising us on how we can create growth. He's already given us advice on some really useful tools that will help with creating tweets, threads and articles. We've also decided to cancel the weekly AMAs and instead do them once a month. We will still be providing weekly updates but in written form, through the WonderlandWizards substack. Most people miss the AMAs for various different reasons and miss out on some quality discussions. We hope the transition to an article format will reach a wider audience. Another reason for doing this is so we have more topic for discussions during Twitter spaces which we want to be pushing out a lot more over the next few weeks. Due to the Twitter algorithm we're seeing more people in the spaces, especially new people. It also give us another way to push out to serious investors who most likely aren't going to be in our discords.<br />
              <br />
              Currently, we are messaging a lot of projects who we think will bring value, as well as trying to schedule some spaces for the Wizards. We will have further updates on this as the conversations progress. We're also going to host a mega space, so if you're bullish or involved in any projects that might want to get involved and come and pitch their projects, let them know.<br />
              <br />
              We also added mint incentives yesterday which are above this announcement. If you missed it be sure to give it a check and let your Wizard friends know. The incentives don't stop there though, we'll be adding more periodically. Stay tuned!<br />
              <br />
              Although the gas fees are frustrating it seems as though NFTs that
              hold their value, live on the Ethereum blockchain.
